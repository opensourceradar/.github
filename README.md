Welcome to the Open Source Radar organization! We're building tools to make open source contribution more accessible, engaging, and rewarding.

## What is Open Source Radar?

Open Source Radar is a platform designed to help developers discover and contribute to open source projects effortlessly. Our key features include:

- **AI-Powered Issue Classification**: Automatically summarizes GitHub issues and assigns difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) using AI.
- **Repository Discovery**: Browse popular repositories and filter issues based on difficulty, labels, and more.
- **Gamification**: Earn badges, XP, and track your contribution timeline to stay motivated.
- **Community Tools**: Easy ways to report bugs, request features, and discuss ideas.

Our mission is to lower the barriers to open source participation, especially for beginners, while providing valuable insights for project maintainers.

## Our Projects

- **[opensourceradar-api](https://github.com/opensourceradar/opensourceradar-api)**: The backend service built with Go, handling GitHub integration, AI classification, and data storage in PostgreSQL.
- **[opensourceradar-web](https://github.com/opensourceradar/opensourceradar-web)**: The frontend application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, providing an intuitive user interface.
- **[community](https://github.com/opensourceradar/community)**: Our central hub for bug reports, feature requests, discussions, and community feedback.

## How It Works

1. **Sign In with GitHub**: Authenticate using OAuth for seamless integration.
2. **Discover Repositories**: Search and browse GitHub repositories.
3. **View Classified Issues**: See AI-generated summaries, difficulty ratings, and labels.
4. **Contribute**: Jump directly to GitHub to create pull requests.
5. **Track Progress**: Earn badges and view your contribution timeline.
